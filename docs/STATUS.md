# Status

The current state of the project: what is released in the code, what still
needs checking against real services, and what a deployment needs.
`docs/ROADMAP.md` is the plan; this file is the current state.

Last updated: 28 October 2026.

## Current release

Phase 103R (Yallapp Studio as the owner approved it) is under way. A
Studio page is a tree of elements (`AppPage.studio`): rows, columns, layers,
grids and sliders; texts, pictures, buttons, lists with the owner's own card,
categories, videos, forms, maps, ratings and search, sized to fill, hug or a
fixed size, light and dark, with motion. Done:
- the contract;
- the editor at `/studio/editor`, as in the approved design;
- serving by the hosted API and plugin 0.4.26, with forms on a Studio page
  answered like the form block;
- the app drawing the tree natively;
- Studio's own section of the account: its home with the projects, a new
  project in three steps and each project's dashboard, as the owner
  approved them; Studio projects (`App.section` "studio") apart from the
  regular apps, on Studio's own plans (Admin › Plans › Yallapp Studio).

Studio's plans are offered once the team turns them on and prices them;
until then a project designs and tries everything, and publishing it to
the stores waits for a plan. Checks: redocly lint, platform unit tests, e2e
of Studio's section and editor, composer lint, plugin unit tests, flutter
analyze and widget tests.

Phase 102 (a store review account in every app, required) is complete:
Publishing › Store review account holds the reviewers' sign-in for every
app (App sign-in's fixed number or email and code where Yallapp signs people
in; an account of the site or API, its password encrypted, elsewhere), with
the steps for Play Console and App Store Connect. Ready to submit and the
checks before a build need it. Checks: platform unit tests, e2e of
publishing and the client flow.

Phase 101 (header types in the regular editor) is complete: Pages & look ›
Look › Header offers Title, Centered, Logo and Search, with up to four
buttons (search, cart, notifications, chat, account). The app shows it on
the pages in the bottom tabs; WordPress sites pass it on from plugin
0.4.24. Checks: redocly lint, platform unit tests, composer lint and the
plugin's integration suite, flutter analyze and widget tests.

Phase 100 (courses and memberships bought in the app through Google Play
Billing and the App Store's in-app purchase) is complete (steps 100.1 to
100.7):

| Step | What | Checks |
|---|---|---|
| 100.1 | Contract: store products, purchases, notifications, `Config.store_billing` | redocly lint |
| 100.2 | Store connections and products in Google Play and App Store Connect | unit, e2e, MariaDB migrations |
| 100.3 | Purchases checked with Google and Apple, access given and taken back | unit (with the store suite on MariaDB), e2e |
| 100.4 | WordPress plugin 0.4.23: gives and takes access on the site | composer lint, `php -l`, PHPUnit, the LMS integration suites |
| 100.5 | App: Google Play Billing and StoreKit, restore, manage subscription | dart format, flutter analyze, flutter test |
| 100.6 | Sales in Analytics and the Owner API, the guide, the terms | unit, e2e (analytics, owner API, public pages) |
| 100.7 | Apps on their own API, Teachable and Thinkific schools | unit, MariaDB store suites, e2e of the dashboard |

## To verify against real services before release

These parts were tested against recorded answers or could not run in the
test environment:

- The plugin's calls into LearnDash and WooCommerce Subscriptions (both are
  paid plugins).
- Teachable's enrolment calls (`POST /enroll`, `POST /unenroll`), its price
  unit (taken as the minor unit) and its `one_time` payment type.
- Thinkific's enrolment calls (`POST /enrollments`,
  `PUT /enrollments/{id}` with `expiry_date`) and its `one-time` payment
  type.
- Restore purchases on an iPhone, and phones without Google Play.

## Known gaps

- The Owner API returns `in_app_sales`, but Yallapp Business does not show it
  yet.
- Apps built before Phase 102 without a review sign-in can't start a new
  build until the owner adds one on Publishing.
- Until an app turns on in-app purchases, its Android app keeps the website
  checkout for paid courses.
- An app on its own API returns `store_billing` and the `store` action from
  its own API (the developer guide's "Sell in the app").
- Studio pages need the app update that draws them: older apps show a
  Studio page empty. The Studio editor shows the canvas left to right; the
  app mirrors it in right-to-left languages.

## Deployment

- Migrations up to `0092` (`npm run db:migrate` in `platform/web`).
- Google real-time notifications use one Pub/Sub topic for every app
  (`GOOGLE_PUBSUB_PUSH_EMAIL`, `GOOGLE_PUBSUB_TOPIC`; see
  `docs/LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md`). Each app's owner enters the topic in their own
  Play Console › Monetization setup; the platform finds the app by its
  package name.
- Plugin 0.4.23 goes to sites once the app update with in-app purchases is
  in the stores; 0.4.24 (the header) and 0.4.26 (Studio pages) after the
  app update that shows them.

## Planned (to agree on before any work)

- **Delivery and courier companies** (Phase 104, the first project type
  only Studio has), then more project types (Phase 105) and the Studio
  template marketplace (Phase 106, postponed): see `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
